Each round consisted of either purely conceptual/resume/OS questions and/or leetcode questions. Expect 1 to 3 (yes 3) mediums in 45 minutes. I solved every question optimally (space and runtime) and under time, except for one interview which I ran out of time. No offer, even after I was told by the recruiter that she received good feedback so far.

However, like most MAANNG interview panels, one person was mildly a dick and had a thick accent which I couldn't decipher. I wasted a ton of time with him because I couldn't understand when I tried to clarify the problem statement. After I finally got it, I was running into a compile error (Hackerrank) which burned my time, and that was that.

No system design. Need to know OS structure in and out. Need to know low level programming. Need to solve mediums in 12 minutes flat imo when you factor in all the concept/resume questions prior.

Overall, I have a job already so I'm not that bummed. But I did really want this role. A warning to others: perfection is the expectation in the current job market.

The most effective way to prepare for an Nvidia interview is to practice real Nvidia interview questions. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a cheatsheet for your Nvidia interview, so you know the answer to questions before they’re asked? Luckily, this cheat sheet exists–Nvidia published it themselves. Nvidia outlines common interview questions, the values they’re looking for, and the interview process on their own site. Nvidia employees and candidates have shared real Nvidia interview questions and the Nvidia interview process all over the internet on sites like Glassdoor and LeetCode. But how do you know which questions will actually be asked? We’ve compiled the most common Nvidia interview questions and answers so you can go into your interview with confidence.

How Not to Answer Nvidia Interview Questions

One of the worst mistakes candidates make is just casually scanning Nvidia interview questions online before their interview. They study questions carefully, but don’t prepare answers–they plan to “wing” their answers. But Nvidia interviewers certainly don’t have such a casual attitude. They’ll carefully note your responses and meticulously review what you shared.

While you shouldn’t memorize interview responses word-for-word, you should have a pitch prepared along with common interview responses and example experiences. And if you’re preparing for an Nvidia interview, don’t just read the questions in this article. Actually write your own response (or modify our example answers), then practice the answers aloud with a friend or in the mirror. You will absolutely be asked some of the Nvidia interview questions in this guide.

Common Nvidia Interview Questions from Their Own Website

Unlike other top tech companies, Nvidia is fairly tight-lipped about their interview process and common questions. They published only one web page outlining their entire interview process. Technical questions will usually be asked over Hackerrank. Behavioral Nvidia interview questions vary by team, but still screen for cultural alignment and experience.

Nvidia hiring is team specific, as confirmed by a real Nvidia interviewer on Blind. That means that each Nvidia team chooses which interview questions to ask and how to conduct interviews. While the hiring process and principles are very similar across teams, specific questions are up to the team members. However, Nvidia team members are usually extremely busy–now more than ever. This means that technical questions will often be copied directly from Leetcode or Hackerank.

Nvidia’s behavioral interview questions assess your alignment with Nvidia’s core values:

While Nvidia interview questions assess complete cultural fit, real Nvidia interviewers say they’re especially looking for these traits:

Although Nvidia doesn’t directly state it on their website like other tech companies, Nvidia almost always asks behavioral questions based on past experiences. They expect you to prepare past experiences to perform well, according to candidates who’ve interviewed at Nvidia. This means STAR interview technique (situation, task, action, result) will be the most critical step to succeeding in any interview. Here are some examples of behavioral questions at Nvidia.

Tell me about a time you failed.

Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager.

Tell me about a time you faced a tight deadline with limited resources.

These types of questions will come up in almost any interview you will ever have or have had. But since these questions are so common, we won’t analyze them in-depth here. Check out our full guides on answering “tell me about yourself” questions and “what areas do you need to develop further” questions–these simple questions come up in almost every interview. Instead, we want to focus on technical and behavioral interview questions specific to Nvidia.

Behavioral Nvidia Interview Questions

Half or more of your Nvidia interview questions will probably be behavioral. But the most critical behavioral questions will be specific to Nvidia as a company. These questions are designed to assess how you think and relate to Nvidia–their culture, mission, and values. While these questions don’t necessarily require you to know anything about Nvidia, sharing Nvidia-specific information will certainly help you prove your genuine interest and culture fit.

1. Why do you want to work for Nvidia?

This is your chance to demonstrate cultural alignment with Nvidia and show you’ve done your research. While you obviously shouldn’t lie, prepare a thoughtful answer that’s connected to Nvidia’s stated cultural values.

Based on our data, the most effective way to answer is to explain why you’re a good candidate and how you connect to the company mission, values, products, and goals. This is especially important in Nvidia interviews, since cultural fit behavioral questions usually make up half or more of Nvidia interview questions. Check out our full guide to answering “Why do you want to work here” questions because they’ll come up in almost every interview. However, your answer should depend on the company. Nvidia in particular prefers candidates who have an interest in working at Nvidia long-term,

Our answer:

“That’s a great question. I want to work at Nvidia because I feel that our goals align. I have always been passionate about empowering creators with new technology, especially AI, just like how Nvidia empowers people with computing to transform the world’s largest industries.

In my past role as a machine learning engineer at Etsy, I worked on an AI algorithm to double the scale of its “Best of Etsy library”. The library was curated by merchandisers based on an item’s visual appeal–we needed an algorithm to make the results more relevant. I integrated multiple search engine technologies to incorporate relational) and semantic data as well as the word searched. This resulted in a 15% increase in customer satisfaction with “Best of Etsy” library results. My team’s Machine learning work also allowed Etsy to spot listings that violate our handmade policy, increasing discovered and removed violations by 29% in just one quarter.

With my experience working with Etsy AI to deliver the most relevant results, I know I can provide valuable input to the team so that Nvidia can continue to empower and transform industries with AI. In addition, I know that as a company Nvidia values intellectual honesty and speed, which are extremely important to me in my future role. I am looking to join a growing technology company that is disrupting the world with AI technology. While I loved my prior roles, I want to be more directly involved in AI disruption and pioneering–Nvidia is the perfect place for my skills.”

2. Tell me about a time when you had to work under pressure or a tight deadline.

This is another open-ended experience based question that should be answered with STAR. However, “deadline” and “pressure” should immediately make you think about Nvidia’s cultural value of speed and agility. Based on candidate experiences, Nvidia also emphasizes being an independent self-starter, while communicating as “one team”. We recommend sharing a situation from a previous work experience that demonstrates you working quickly with initiative.

Our answer:

“Nvidia values speed and so do I. As a UX intern at Roblox, I had a tight 2 week deadline to revamp the UX for the homepage to highlight Roblox’s live streaming capabilities. Looking to the future, I wanted to make sure that users were consistently shown new and exciting live streams going forward. So I created a “today’s picks” of live streams that displayed popular live streams based on the user’s previous viewing history. After meeting with the dev team, I also increased the size of livestream thumbnails to 16:9 to make them the most prominent on the home page. By moving quickly and working cross functionally, I was able to finish in just 10 days. Our homepage revamp increased livestream views from the homepage by 62% and added almost a thousand hours of watchtime.”

3. How do you adapt to new technologies and trends in your field?

This question is assessing your alignment with Nvidia’s “adaptability” value. While it can seem like a simple one-sentence response, we still recommend using the STAR method and sharing a past experience. This makes your answer more concrete and allows you to prove your impact and familiarity with Nvidia.

Our answer:

“The machine learning field is evolving at a fast pace–I’ve always found it exciting. When I was working at Etsy, AWS Machine Learning became increasingly popular. My manager asked that my team switch to Amazon SageMaker to develop and deploy machine learning models. Thankfully, I’d already heard of the tool because I was a subscriber to a daily AI newsletter. After my manager’s announcement, I took a few hours each day for the first month to practice the tool after work. I quickly became the office expert on AWS, supporting my teammates with the transition. This resulted in significantly faster deployment. Like Nvidia, I think adaptability is critical, especially in AI. I’m committed to proactive continual learning to adapt to whatever technology has the most impact in the field.”

You can use the same STAR method to answer these other Nvidia interview questions. Since questions are team specific, they’ll generally be the same 25 common interview questions that come up in almost every interview at top companies.

Technical Nvidia Interview Questions from LeetCode

Like Amazon and Netflix, Nvidia interview questions are team-specific. Nvidia team members choose specific interview questions themselves. However, team members are very busy. They’ll often ask questions straight from Leetcode.

Last year, a GitHub user compiled a list of Leetcode Nvidia interview questions directly from Leetcode. For questions with context, Redditor recently shared their experience with Lettcode-style Nvidia interview questions. We still recommend paying for Leetcode to practice for technical interview questions at Nvidia. But if you can’t pay for Leetcode, you can use the Github list and Reddit posts. We’ve also included some of the most common LeetCode style Nvidia interview questions below.

Technical Nvidia Interview Questions for Software Engineers

For software engineers, Nvidia interview questions are usually medium difficulty leetcode questions. However, time is limited. You may only have 45 minutes to solve 3 medium-difficulty Leetcode challenges. Beside Leetcode questions, here are some of the most common Nvidia interview questions asked in software engineering interviews.

Count the number of bits in an integer (fast solution).

C++ coding questions

Knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

How do polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance work?

What are the differences between C and C++?

How does static work?

What are the types of casting in C++?

How does memory work in a C++ program?

What is the use of stack and queue in OS?

What is stack overflow?

Concurrency related questions.

Random number generation techniques.

Find all the possible combinations of letters.

Writing stack/queue data structure using class, specify methods, attributes, etc.

Strings reversal using recursion, explain recursion pros and cons.

How would you go about trying to implement video segmentation using neural networks?

Create a synchronization barrier for a multithreaded task.

What is bus arbitration and how do you optimize switch daemon?

What are virtual functions and why do we need them?

How do you process an image in CUDA?

How do you map threads? Is it memory-bound or compute-bound?

How do you use semaphores?

Nvidia Interview Questions for Data Scientists and Machine Learning

Data science Nvidia interview questions usually include Leetcode medium-difficulty challenges. Expect questions on machine learning and queries. Beside Leetcode questions, here are some other common Nvidia interview questions for data scientists.

Provide a summary of a project you have worked on with big data.

Build a recommendation system, from beginning to end.

Find an anomaly within a time series dataset.

Write an equation for linear regression.

Explain how a decision tree works.

Interview

I recently interviewed for a Software Intern position at NVIDIA, and although I was not selected, the experience was both challenging and rewarding. Here’s a quick rundown of my journey: Application Process: I applied online through NVIDIA’s careers portal. Within a couple of weeks, I received an email for an online assessment, which focused on coding and problem-solving skills. Online Assessment: The assessment consisted of a few data structures and algorithms problems, mostly focusing on arrays, strings, and graph-related questions. The questions were of medium to high difficulty, and time management was key. I managed to solve most of them but could have optimized one or two solutions better. Technical Interview (Virtual): I was then shortlisted for a technical interview. The interviewer was friendly and began with a brief intro. The interview was about an hour long and included: DSA Questions: Focused on trees and dynamic programming. I was asked to explain my approach and write clean, optimized code. Conceptual Questions: A few CS fundamentals like OS concepts (process vs thread), memory management, and networking basics. Project Discussion: I walked through one of my major projects. The interviewer was interested in the problem I solved, technologies used, and challenges faced. Final Thoughts: Although I didn’t make it to the final round or get an offer, the experience helped me understand NVIDIA’s high standards and gave me insights into areas I need to improve, especially optimizing code under time pressure and brushing up on system design basics. The interviewers were professional, and the process was smooth and well-organized. I appreciate the opportunity and will use this experience to grow and prepare better for future interviews. Key Takeaways: Strong DSA skills are a must. Be ready to explain your projects deeply. Brush up on CS fundamentals, especially OS and system-level concepts. Looking forward to applying again in the future and coming back stronger!

Nvidia's Interview Process for Software Engineers: 2-4 Steps

Mid to senior-level engineers interviewing at Nvidia can expect the following process:

[Can skip if referred in] Recruiter call (30 minutes)

Technical phone screen (1 hour)

[Not always] Hiring Manager call (30 minutes)

Onsite (5 hours)

Nvidia has a decentralized process that varies based on the hiring manager's preference, e.g., some people we spoke with had no recruiter screen and some had no hiring manager call before the onsite. One candidate even had their hiring manager call first, before anything else happened! The onsite rounds can also change a lot. We will do our best to sketch out the process, but yours may differ depending on the role you are interviewing for. While there is some flexibility regarding what role you end up interviewing for, you don’t seem to be able to interview for multiple teams. All of your interviewers will be from the team you are interviewing for.

One engineer we spoke to, who interviewed with Nvidia for two separate teams told us:

If you get an early hiring manager call, you can ask them exactly what to expect in the rest of the rounds. If they say the language is the priority, brush up on those skills, if they say it will be more general, then focus on general coding.

General tips:

LeetCode practice will help, but they will throw in more practical questions too.

They don’t have an internal question bank, so the interview questions are up to the individual interviewer.

Nvidia puts a premium on experience and advanced academic degrees.

A good (senior) referral can help you skip the recruiter call.

Most roles they hire for are software-orientedsoftware oriented, not hardware as you might expect

If you fail with one team, you can immediately interview with another one, but you will have to go through the whole process again, though it’s possible you’ll be able to skip the technical phone screen.

They will always have at least one interview that is focused on the language you will need for whatever team you are joining.

The entire process takes about 6-8 weeks.

Step 1: Recruiter Call

Nvidia’s recruiter call lasts 30 minutes, and it’s pretty standard fare – they’ll ask you about your previous experience, and why you’re interested in Nvidia and do some basic skills assessment.

It’s really important, at this stage, to not reveal your salary expectations or where you are in the process with other companies. We’ve written a detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say if recruiters pressure you to name the first number.

Step 2: Technical Phone Screen

You might start with 15 minutes of general chat in this round but, the guts of the interview will be technical. In the general chat, you might be asked about your background and why you’re interested in Nvidia. The technical portion will be 45 minutes long. One engineer we spoke to was asked only LLM questions here and everything was done in PyTorch, but this is largely dependent on the role you are interviewing for. Nvidia is very focused on hiring engineers with LLM experience right now so, if that’s what you applied to, expect LLM questions rather than general CS skill questions. If not, expect a LeetCode medium-style question, but remember, they don’t have an internal bank from what we’ve heard, so you might get something more practical too.

If you are asked LLM questions, expect them to focus on concepts such as:

Mixture-of-experts model

Beam search

Autoregressive decoding with KV-cache

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)

High-level distributed computing

For example, you might be asked to implement beam search for LLM inference and evaluate the time complexity of each operation.

Step 3: Hiring Manager Call

This is usually split into two parts. You will be asked about your background and experience in the first part. The hiring manager will be testing for culture fit. In the second part, they will be selling you on the role and team.

Step 4: Onsite

This will vary by role but here’s what you can expect.

Coding x 2 (1 hour each). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the Coding section below.

(1 hour each). This interview will be conducted in CoderPad. For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the Coding section below. System design (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the System Design section below.

(1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the System Design section below. Second Coding (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the Coding (domain-specific) section below.

(1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the Coding (domain-specific) section below. Hiring Manager (1 hour). For more detail about the kinds of questions to expect, see the Hiring Manager interview section below.

Types of Interview Questions to Expect at Nvidia

Coding

Ok, things can vary quite a bit here, as with everything in the Nvidia hiring process! One engineer we spoke to had 2 low-level coding rounds that were very practical and domain-aligned for the team he interviewed with. Others got more standard LeetCode-style questions during these two rounds.

We also heard that there are different formats for the coding rounds for certain teams. You might get a problem to solve in some and have to review existing code in others, similar to a debugging round.

If the role you have applied to will rely heavily on Cuda, expect to be interviewed in C++. Every role at Nvidia is a bit different though so lot’s of languages are used. It should be clear from the job description if there is a specific language required. If not, ask the hiring manager in advance so you are prepared!

Below are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter in Nvidia interviews. To compile this list, we did two things. First, we spoke to some current and former Nvidia engineers. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews.

First, here’s a list of more niche technical topics that are, in our experience, specific to Nvidia:

C++ Fundamentals

LLMs See the technical phone screen section above for examples of LLM sub-topics



And here are technical topics that you’re likely to find at other companies as well (for these we’ve created detailed write-ups of their own):
